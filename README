This is a 2D simulation of the reaction-diffusion model according to
Gray-Scott. Some background theory can be found here:

 * http://www.mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia
 * http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/amorphous/GrayScott

The PDEs behind the reaction-diffusion simulation are used as non-naive examples
to test code optimization techniques like C++/STL's multi-threading, hand-
-tuned SIMD-assembly (64 bit x86) and comparing it against compiler-generated
code.

A brief screencast of the code in action can be seen here:

The dependencies are modest:

 * cmake 2.8.12
 * nasm 2.11.08
 * C++-14 compiler (e.g. g++, clang++)
 * SDL 2.0.5

I compiles and runs under recent Linux-distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 15.04) as well
as MacOS X 10.10.5 ("Yosemite"). It should run with little or no changes under
Windows 7 (or more recent) too. But that has not yet been tested. Feedback and
patches are welcome.
